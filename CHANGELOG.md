# Changelog

## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-06

### Changed
- Documented OpenUPM as an optional UPM registry install source for users who want Unity Package Manager to show registry-backed version history.
- Added optional release-script verification for OpenUPM indexing after new tags are published.

### Fixed
- Fixed `capture_game_view` returning black frames in URP/HDRP projects by reading the rendered Game View frame before falling back to `camera.Render()`. (#11, #12)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-06

### Changed
- `execute_code` now compiles snippets through Unity's bundled Roslyn csc first while preserving the in-memory compilation/execution flow. This improves support for modern C# syntax such as target-typed `new()` and switch expressions without writing snippet files into the Unity project.
- Release packaging now explicitly rejects local IDE metadata and macOS `.DS_Store` files in addition to tests, local notes, token files, and host-project folders.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-03

### Changed
- Narrowed optional `execute_code` project namespace auto-injection to loaded assemblies under `Library/ScriptAssemblies`, reducing wrapper size and type-name ambiguity when the opt-in setting is enabled.

### Fixed
- Downgraded expected response-write failures after client disconnects or domain reloads so `socket has been shut down` no longer appears as a Unity Console error.
- Marked non-resumed tools interrupted by script recompilation as `Interrupted` in Recent Activity instead of showing a misleading green `OK`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-02

### Changed
- `execute_code` no longer auto-injects project namespaces by default. The optional MCP Settings toggle now derives namespaces from loaded project assemblies instead of regex-scanning source files, avoiding source-only, conditional, or asmdef-isolated namespaces that can make every snippet fail with `COMPILATION_FAILED`. (#9)
- Moved `execute_code` safety controls out of the MCP Server window and into **Funplay > MCP Settings** alongside debug logging.

## [0.3.9] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Added stricter default-on filesystem safety checks for `execute_code`, covering broad `System.IO` writes, raw file streams, absolute/user/system paths, and path traversal patterns while clearly documenting that this is not a full sandbox.
- Added a local release helper script for version bumping, Unity test/export flows, unitypackage pathname validation, release notes, checksums, and optional publishing.

### Changed
- Split the MCP Server window into smaller focused panels and moved related settings, tool exposure, project skills, and skills management classes out of the monolithic window file.
- Standardized tool error results on structured JSON envelopes with `success:false`, `code`, `error`, and optional `data`; legacy `Error:` text is no longer treated as an error signal.
- Disabled verbose plugin debug logging by default and kept high-volume request logs in the Recent Activity UI instead of the Unity Console.

### Fixed
- Filtered release unitypackages through an explicit asset list so local-only files, tests, ProjectSettings, Packages, Library, and token files cannot be included accidentally.
- Hardened release-script cleanup, non-publishing flows, and Unity export handling so a lingering batchmode process does not block package validation after a package has already been written.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Added a default-on `execute_code` safety checks toggle to the MCP Server window. Clients that omit the `safety_checks` argument now use this project-level default, while explicit tool arguments still override it.

### Fixed
- Reworked the MCP HTTP transport to use a directly owned loopback TCP listener and retry post-domain-reload binds, avoiding Windows/Unity 6 `Address already in use` recovery failures caused by stale listener state.
- Avoided Unity synchronization-context capture during transport bind retries so occupied-port recovery cannot stall the editor when callers synchronously wait on startup.
- Hardened editor-thread queued task cleanup during server disposal so pending work is cancelled cleanly across domain reloads.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- Added a project-path-hash identity to MCP `initialize` responses so an existing Funplay listener can be verified as belonging to the same Unity project without exposing the raw local path.
- When HTTP binding finds the configured port already occupied, the transport now probes `initialize` and attaches only if both the Funplay server name and project identity match.
- Attached transports detach without closing the owning listener, while owned transports still stop and close their `HttpListener` normally.
- Probe timeouts and unrelated listeners are treated as probe failures, not as external cancellation.
- The MCP Server window now distinguishes an attached existing server from a listener owned by the current service.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- Made MCP server start idempotent across concurrent window, settings, and domain-reload startup paths so repeated Start calls reuse the same in-flight startup instead of creating competing HTTP transports.
- Hardened HTTP transport cleanup during Unity reloads and Stop/Dispose races, including already-disposed `HttpListener` instances.
- Recognize Windows and Mono `HttpListener` address-in-use variants (`10048`, `183`, `Only one usage...`, and `another listener...`) during restart retry detection.
- Clean up partially initialized server transport, request handler, and resource provider state after failed or cancelled starts.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- Updated LM Studio one-click configuration to use the official `lmstudio://add_mcp` flow and avoid creating guessed Windows `mcp.json` paths. Existing LM Studio config files are still updated when found.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- Added LM Studio to the MCP Server window's one-click configuration targets. The generated config writes `funplay` to LM Studio's `mcp.json` using Cursor-compatible `mcpServers` JSON.
- Documented manual LM Studio setup paths for macOS/Linux and Windows.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- Unitypackage-based updates now filter downloaded release packages before import and only allow paths under the installed `Assets/unity-mcp` root. This prevents accidental release artifacts from overwriting host-project `ProjectSettings`, `Packages`, or `Library` files during one-click updates.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- `Funplay > MCP Server` window now shows the installed package version, polls GitHub for new releases every 6 hours, and surfaces a one-click update prompt when a newer version is available. Auto-check is skipped in Unity batch mode.

### Fixed
- Post-domain-reload server restart is now resilient to (a) the `[InitializeOnLoad]` vs `afterAssemblyReload` ordering race — the handler also kicks off a restart from its own static ctor if reload bookkeeping is pending, (b) `EditorApplication.isCompiling` still being true when the `delayCall` fires, (c) the service provider not yet being available, (d) duplicate scheduling. The restart now retries via `EditorApplication.update` until the editor is settled.
- `HttpMCPTransport.StartAsync` now retries up to 10 seconds (40 × 250 ms) when the port is briefly held by an unwinding listener after an AppDomain transition. Eliminates residual `Address already in use` failures that 0.3.1 did not fully cover for fast-reload scenarios.
- `DomainReloadHandler.CompletePendingFunction` defers the pending-function clear when the editor is mid-compile / mid-update / about to change Play Mode, instead of clearing immediately and racing the reload. 15-second fallback timeout prevents indefinite deferral.
- Root services and MCP server startup are now no-ops in Unity batch mode (`-batchmode`), so running batch jobs in parallel with a foreground Editor that already binds port 8765 no longer conflicts.
- `request_recompile` now returns a clear error when called while Unity is in Play Mode (Unity does not process script compilation or domain reloads while playing). Call `exit_play_mode` first, then retry.

### Changed
- `unity-mcp-workflow` skill (and the generated `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` templates) now document two Play Mode lifecycle pitfalls: (1) after `enter_play_mode`, the HTTP server is briefly unreachable while Unity reloads the domain — poll `tools/list` / `get_reload_recovery_status` until it responds before issuing the next call; (2) `request_recompile` is rejected during Play Mode and must be preceded by `exit_play_mode`. Existing installs should regenerate Project Skills via `Funplay > Project Skills` to pick up the new content.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- Compile errors on Unity 6000.3+ where `Object.GetInstanceID()` and `EditorUtility.InstanceIDToObject(int)` are obsolete-as-error (CS0619). Object IDs handed to MCP clients now go through a new internal `ObjectIdHelper` that uses `GetEntityId` / `EditorUtility.EntityIdToObject` on Unity 6000.3+ and the legacy `InstanceID` API on older Unity. (#3)
- HTTP transport could fail to restart after a Unity domain reload with `通常每个套接字地址(协议/网络地址/端口)只允许使用一次。` / `Address already in use`. Root cause was a fire-and-forget `StopAsync` in `beforeAssemblyReload` — Unity unloaded the AppDomain before the listener actually released the port. `MCPServerService` now exposes a synchronous `StopSync` used by both `Dispose` and the domain-reload handler, and `RootScopeServices.Initialize` skips its auto-start during a post-reload restart so only one start path runs. (#1)

### Changed (potentially breaking for downstream clients)
- `instanceId`, `componentInstanceId`, and `fileID` fields in tool responses are now always JSON strings instead of numbers. On Unity 6000.3+ they are `EntityId` text; on older Unity they are decimal `InstanceID` strings. Clients that parsed these fields as integers must accept strings.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- New foundation helpers under `Editor/Tools/Helpers/`: `ObjectsHelper` (unified by_id/by_name/by_path/by_tag/by_layer/by_component locator with searchInactive / searchInChildren / findAll, prefab-stage aware), `ComponentSerializer` (SerializedObject-based read/write that picks up `[SerializeField] private`, Object references via `{"fileID": instanceId}`, Vector/Quaternion/Color/Enum/Array), `TypeResolver` (TypeCache-backed O(1) component type lookup), `Response` (structured `{success, message, data}` / `{success, code, error, data}` envelope), `EditorReadyHelper` (refresh + wait for compilation), `GameObjectSerializer` (structured payloads with `instanceId` so agents can chain `by_id` calls).
- New `EditorState` tool provider: `get_editor_state`, `get_selection`, `set_selection`, `get_prefab_stage`, `get_active_tool`, `set_active_tool`, `get_windows`, `get_tags`, `add_tag`, `remove_tag`, `get_layers`, `add_layer`, `get_build_settings`.
- New `MenuItem` tool provider: `execute_menu_item`, `validate_menu_item` — drive any editor menu including third-party packages without writing dedicated wrappers.
- New `IFunplayCommand` + `ExecutionContext` API for `execute_code`. Snippets that implement `IFunplayCommand` get `ctx.RegisterObjectCreation` / `RegisterObjectModification` / `DestroyObject` (auto-Undo + tracked) and `ctx.Log` / `LogWarning` / `LogError` (returned in the response).
- `ComponentPropertyFunctions`: new `component_instance_id` parameter lets tools target a specific component when a GameObject has multiple of the same type.

### Changed
- All `GameObject` tools now resolve targets through `ObjectsHelper` and accept a new `find_method` parameter (defaults to auto-detect: id → path → name).
- `GameObject` and `ComponentProperty` tools now return structured JSON (`Response.Success(...)`) instead of free-form strings, with `instanceId` included so agents can chain `by_id` lookups reliably.
- `ComponentPropertyFunctions.SetComponentProperty(ies)` now writes through `SerializedObject`, so `[SerializeField] private` fields and Object references work; partial writes return per-field success.
- `execute_code` now calls `EditorReadyHelper.RefreshAndWaitForReady` before compiling, so external file edits are picked up automatically — no separate `request_recompile` needed in most flows.
- `FunctionInvokerController` now serializes non-string tool returns to JSON via Newtonsoft, so tools can return `Response.Success(...)` or any object.
- `unity-mcp-workflow` project skill rules updated to cover structured JSON returns, `instanceId` chaining, `find_method`, the new SerializedProperty-backed component setter, the IFunplayCommand template, editor-state tools, and `execute_menu_item` as the preferred fallback before `execute_code`. Generated `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` templates updated to match. Existing installed skills must be regenerated via `Funplay > Project Skills` to pick up the new content.
- `core` profile expanded from 19 to 29 tools: added `get_editor_state`, `get_selection`, `set_selection`, `get_prefab_stage`, `find_game_objects`, `list_components`, `get_component_properties`, `set_component_property`, `set_component_properties`, `execute_menu_item`. Lower-frequency editor-state tools (tag/layer mutation, window listing, build settings, active-tool control, `validate_menu_item`) remain `full`-only.

### Breaking
- `GameObjectFunctions` parameter renames for clarity now that resolution is method-driven: `name` → `target` (delete/duplicate/rename/set_transform/set_active/add_component/set_tag_and_layer/get_game_object_info), `parent_name` → `parent`, `child_name` → `child`. The new `find_method` parameter is optional everywhere.
